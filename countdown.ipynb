    "### **Explanation of the Countdown Numbers Game**\n",
    "\n",
    "The Countdown Numbers Game is a challenging segment of the British game show \"Countdown\". The objective of the game is to reach a target number using a combination of arithmetic operations on a given set of numbers. Here are the detailed rules:\n",
    "\n",
    "##### **Game Setup**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Numbers Selection:** Six numbers are chosen at random. These numbers come from a predefined set that includes:\n",
    "\n",
    "Two sets of the numbers 1 to 10 (inclusive).\n",
    "One set each of the numbers 25, 50, 75, and 100.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Target Number:** A random three-digit number (between 101 and 999 inclusive) is generated. This number serves as the target for the round.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### **Gameplay Rules**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Basic Operations:** Players can use addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (×), and division (÷) to combine the chosen numbers.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Number Usage:**\n",
    "- Each of the six chosen numbers can be used once at most.\n",
    "- If two identical numbers are chosen, each can be used separately.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Restrictions on Operations:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Division: Only allowed if it results in a whole number.\n",
    "- Subtraction: Can only be used if it results in a positive number.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Objective:** Players aim to reach the exact target number or get as close as possible within the given constraints.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### **Scoring**\n",
    "\n",
    "- If a player reaches the target number exactly, they score maximum points.\n",
    "- If no one reaches the target, the player with the closest number scores points based on how close they are.\n",
    "- In some cases, it might not be possible to reach the target number with the given set of numbers."

    "### Common Strategies\n",
    "\n",
    "##### 1. **Prioritise Multiplication and Division**\n",
    "- **Multiplication** can quickly increase the value, especially when using larger numbers. Contestants often try to multiply early to get closer to high targets.\n",
    "- **Division** is useful for adjusting values precisely but can only be used when it results in an integer. Skilled players look for opportunities to divide by numbers that are factors of the current total, especially when the target or intermediate results are large.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### 2. **Use Addition and Subtraction Carefully**\n",
    "- **Addition** is straightforward but can lead to overshooting the target if not planned well.\n",
    "- **Subtraction** can be tricky since it must not result in negative numbers. Players often use subtraction to fine-tune their totals, especially as they get closer to the target number.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### 3. **Backtracking**\n",
    "- If players find themselves far from the target or stuck with unusable numbers, they may backtrack to an earlier step and try a different operation or number pairing. This strategy allows for exploring different paths that might lead closer to the target.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### 4. **Save Key Numbers**\n",
    "- Some numbers are more versatile (like 1, 10, or numbers close to the target). Saving these for the final steps can provide more flexibility in reaching the exact target.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### 5. **Break Down the Target**\n",
    "- Breaking the target number into component parts that are easier to achieve with the available numbers can simplify the process. For instance, if the target is 924, one might aim to create 900 and 24 separately and then add them.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### 6. **Avoid Unnecessary Complexity**\n",
    "- While it might be tempting to use all numbers or complex operations, sometimes simpler solutions are more efficient and less risky. Contestants often evaluate the simplest path to the target before committing to more complex calculations.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### 7. **Practice Mental Math**\n",
    "- Regular practice with mental arithmetic can significantly enhance a contestant's ability to quickly see possible combinations and operations that lead to the target.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### 8. **Use Estimation**\n",
    "- When the game starts, estimating which numbers and operations might be most effective in approaching the target can help in planning the sequence of steps.\n",
    "\n",
    "These strategies require not only mathematical skills but also a strategic approach to problem-solving, where contestants must continually adapt their methods based on the numbers and target they are given."

Ignoring the specific values and focusing on the positions, the number of ways to choose six numbers from a set of 24 (since there are two sets of 1-10, plus the four unique numbers: 25, 50, 75, 100) is given by the combination formula $C(n, k) = \\frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}$. Where $n$ is the total number of items (24) and $k$ is the number of items to choose (6).\n",

This is due to the need to explore nearly every combination of numbers and operations to guarantee finding the solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, practical implementations often use algorithmic rule or optimization techniques to reduce the search space, such as reducing impossible or redundant paths, dynamic programming to reuse intermediate results, or even applying specific algorithms designed for constraint satisfaction problems which can lower the effective complexity for most cases."

    "## Analysis of Reverse Polish Notation (RPN) Complexity\n",
    "\n",
    "Reverse Polish Notation (RPN) is a mathematical notation in which each operator follows all of its operands, removing the need for parentheses to indicate the order of operations. This explanation focuses on the computational aspects of implementing and utilizing RPN, particularly in arithmetic operations that are critical to computational tasks such as those found in your project.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Computational Aspects of RPN**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Parsing RPN**: Parsing an RPN expression involves processing each token—whether an operand or an operator—exactly once in a single, left-to-right pass. This direct method results in a parsing process that scales linearly with the length of the expression, hence the complexity of parsing an RPN expression is \\(O(n)\\), where \\(n\\) is the number of tokens.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Evaluating RPN**: Evaluating an RPN expression also follows a linear trajectory using a stack to manage operands. For each operator, the necessary operands are popped from the stack, the operation is executed, and the result is pushed back onto the stack. Like parsing, the evaluation process handles each token once, maintaining a linear complexity, \\(O(n)\\).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Efficiency of Stack Operations**\n",
    "- **Push Operation**: Adding an operand or a result to the stack is a quick operation, taking constant time, \\(O(1)\\).\n",
    "- **Pop Operation**: Removing operands for an operation is similarly efficient, occurring in constant time, \\(O(1)\\).\n",
    "- **Peek Operation**: Checking the top value of the stack without removing it also takes place in constant time, \\(O(1)\\).\n",
    "\n",
    "These stack operations contribute to the overall efficiency, ensuring that each token in the RPN expression is processed swiftly, thereby supporting the linear complexity of the RPN evaluation process.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Benefits of RPN in Computational Tasks**\n",
    "- **Simplicity and Reduced Error**: RPN simplifies computations by eliminating the need for parentheses and operator precedence, leading to fewer errors and a straightforward implementation process.\n",
    "- **Speed**: The linear nature of both parsing and evaluating RPN expressions results in faster computation times, reducing both cognitive and computational overhead.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Considerations for Implementation in Computational Projects**\n",
    "In applications such as a solver for the Countdown numbers game using RPN:\n",
    "- **Expression Generation**: Efficiently generating viable RPN expressions that can solve for a target number involves complex strategies to manage the exponential growth of possible combinations.\n",
    "- **Optimization**: Using optimization techniques like memoization can enhance performance, particularly when similar calculations recur.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, Reverse Polish Notation offers an efficient and effective method for handling arithmetic expressions, particularly useful in computational projects that require rapid and reliable calculations. Its streamlined approach and linear complexity make it a favorable choice for algorithmic implementations."

    "## Computational Techniques in the Countdown Numbers Game Solver\n",
    "\n",
    "These are the different computational strategies we use in our Countdown game solver. These methods are crucial for making the solver both effective and efficient:\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. **Recursive Depth Search**\n",
    "Our solver uses a method called \"recursive depth-first search\" in the `explore_combinations` function. This technique explores each possible combination of numbers and operations by diving deep into each option, then backtracking to try new possibilities until all numbers are used or a solution is found. It's a thorough way to ensure we check every possible solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. **Big O Notation**\n",
    "The performance of our solver is mainly determined by its factorial complexity, denoted as O(n!). This is because the solver checks all permutations of numbers and all combinations of operations, which makes the solver slower with the addition of more numbers. Understanding this helps us manage performance expectations.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. **Pruning Invalid Operations**\n",
    "To make our solver faster, we use the `operation_allowed` function, which stops the solver from following paths that won't work, like dividing by zero or getting negative results. This step reduces unnecessary calculations, making our solver more efficient.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. **Dynamic Input Handling**\n",
    "The `setup_game` function lets players choose how many large numbers to include, which changes the difficulty level of the game. This not only makes the game more interesting but also lets us see how changes affect the solver's performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. **Permutation Generation**\n",
    "We use a Python library feature, `itertools.permutations`, to try out every possible order of numbers. This is important because the order in which numbers are combined can change the result, especially with operations like subtraction and division.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6. **Time Complexity Measurement**\n",
    "We measure how long it takes to find a solution, which helps us understand how effective our solver is. This feedback is crucial for seeing how different setups or changes in the algorithm affect the time it takes to solve the game.\n",

    "### 7. **Memoization (Potential Optimization)**\n",
    "Memoization is a technique we could add to improve our solver. It involves saving the results of previous calculations so that we don't have to do them again, which could make our solver faster, especially for larger games.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 8. **Operator Handling**\n",
    "Each arithmetic operation is carefully checked to make sure it's allowed under the game rules. This is done in the `operation_allowed` function, which helps maintain the integrity of the game by avoiding illegal moves.\n",
    "\n",
    "By understanding these techniques, you can see how our Countdown game solver works not just to solve the game, but to do it as efficiently as possible. These explanations should give you a good grasp of the computational strategies involved in our project."
